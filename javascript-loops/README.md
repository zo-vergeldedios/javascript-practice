# JavaScript To-Do List (Prompt + Loops)

A simple terminal-based to-do list app using `prompt()`, a `while` loop, and an array to store user input. This was built to practice **JavaScript loops**, conditionals, and basic DOM-independent logic.

## How It Works

- The script continuously prompts the user to enter tasks.
- Typing `done` ends the loop.
- The final to-do list is printed out in the console with numbered items.

## Concepts Practiced

- `while (true)` infinite loop with a `break` condition
- `prompt()` input handling
- `.toLowerCase().trim()` input sanitization
- `forEach()` for list iteration
- Counter variable for numbering output

## Notes

This runs in the browser console (not on a web page). To test it:

1. Open any browser.
2. Paste the code into the **DevTools Console** (right-click → Inspect → Console tab).
3. Follow the prompts!
